    by a closed valve. Both containers are initially at STP. The valve is opened. After some time,
    the gases are thoroughly mixed, quasistatically, by diffusion. What is the final entropy of mixing
    in $J/K$?

    B, holding an additional $0.1$ mole of air at $100^{\circ} C$. The whole A-B assembly is insulated. The
    valve separating the containers is opened and the gases are allowed to equilibrate quasistatically.

    to generate electrical power. Some relevant thermodynamic data for this reaction (per mole, at
    2$98 ~ K$ and $1$ bar) are reproduced here from the Schroeder textbook (pp. 404-405), and from
    \emph{Lange's Handbook of Chemistry}:
