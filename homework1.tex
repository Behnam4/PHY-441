    \item \textbf{1.15} Estimate the average temperature of the air inside a hot-air balloon (see Figure 1.1). Assume

          The atmosphere is filled with air that exerts buoyant force on any object. A hot air balloon rises and 
          floats due to the buoyant force. It descends when the balloon's weight is higher than the buoyant force. 
          It becomes stationary when the weight equals the buoyant force.

            \item $M=500 ~ kg$ is the total mass of the unfilled balloon and payload.

    \item \textbf{1.17} Even at low density, real gases don't quite obey the ideal gas law. A systematic way to account for deviations 
    from ideal behavior is the \textbf{virial expansion},
    $$
      PV=n ~ RT \bigg(1+\dfrac{B(T)}{(V/n)}+\dfrac{C(T)}{(V/n)^2}+...\bigg),
    $$
    where the functions $B(T), C(T)$, and so on are called \textbf{virial coefficients}... 
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item For each temperature in the table, compute the second term in the virial equation, $B(T)/(V/n),$ for nitrogen at atmospheric
      pressure. Discuss the validity of the ideal gas law under these conditions.

          \\
          With a good approximation we can ignore all the other terms in the parenthesis except the first term since their denominators
          are way larger than their denominators, therefore their values are pretty small. With this assumption we have.

          We see that at higher temperatures the correction to the ideal las gas at atmospheric pressure is becooming really small. 
          And at a given volume the pressure is around 2\% smaller.

      \item Think about the forces between molecules, and explain why we might expect $B(T)$ to be negative at low temperatures but positive 
      at high temperatures.

        \textcolor{hwColor}{
          \\
          We know that the pressure of a gas is a measure of the average momentum of moving molecules of a gas. The forces between
          molecules is either attarctive or repulsive. Attractive forces between them are in lower temperatures whereas repulsive forces
          are in higher temperatures, since the molecules move slowly in low temperatures. Also, attraction forces between
          molecules (at low temperatures) should decrease the pressure showing the virial coefficient term negative, hence $B(T)$ is negative.  
        }

      \item Any proposed relation between $P, V,$ ans $T$, like the ideal gas law or the virial equations, is called an \textbf{equation of state}.
      Another famous equation of state, which is qualitatively accurate even for dense fluids, is the \textbf{van der Waals equation},
      $$
        \bigg(P+\dfrac{an^2}{V^2}\bigg) \bigg(V-nb\bigg)=nRT,

      where $a$ and $b$ are constants that depend on the type of gas. Calculate the second and third virial coefficients (B and C) for a gas
      obeying the van der Waals equation, in terms of a and b. (Hint: The bionomial expansion says that 
      $(1+x)^p \approx 1+px+\dfrac{1}{2} p(p-1) x^2$, provided that $|px|<<1$. Apply this approximation to the quantity 
      $\left[1-(nb/V)\right]^{-1}$).

    will make a rough estimate of the rate at which gas escapes through a hole. (This process is called \textbf{effusion}, at least when 
    the hole is sufficiently small.)

        with this surface in a time interval $\Delta t$ is $P ~ A ~ \Delta t/(2m \overline{v_x})$, where $P$ is the pressure, $m$ is the 
        average molecular mass, and $\overline{v_x}$ is the average $x$ velocity of those molecules that collide with the wall.

        now represents an average over all molecules in the gas. Show that $\overline{v_x}^{1/2}=\sqrt{kT/m}.$

        \item If we now take away this small part of the wall of the container, the molecules that would have collided with it will 
        instead escape through the hole. Assuming that nothing enters through the hole, show that the number $N$ of molecules inside
        the container as a fucntion of time is governed by the differential equation

        Solve this equation (assuming constant temperature) to obtain a formula of the form $N(t)=N(0) ~ e^{-t\tau}$, where $\tau$

        \item Your bicycle tire has a slow leak, so that it goes flat within about an hour after being inflated. Roughly how big is the 
        hole? (Use any reasonable estimate for the volume of the tire.)

        \item In Jules Verne's \emph{Round the Moon}, the escape travelers dispose of a dog's corpse by quickly opening a window,
        tossing it out, and closing the window. Do you think they can do this quickly enough to prevent a significant amount of air
        from escaping? Justify your answer with some rough estimates and calculation.
